# Assignment 14

For this assignment you will create a rock-paper-scissors game. You will use random
numbers to create a computer player and there will be a human player. You could also
try to make a more sophisticated AI, but that probably would require the use of an array or ArrayList.

Rules: Paper beats rock, but loses to scissors. Rock beats scissors, but loses to paper. Scissors beats paper, but loses to rock.

### Specifications

* You need to have 2 classes.

* Your `Runner` class should only take input and call method(s) to run the game and/or print the result. All logic
should be in your custom class.

* You need to use at least one `else if` and at least one `else` in your program.
